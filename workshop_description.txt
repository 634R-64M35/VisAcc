Have you ever worn an accessory, only to realize it doesn't appear on your character?

Visual Accessories provides a solution! Simply equip the item of your choosing and enjoy!

The base mod supports only vanilla, more addons with compatilibity for other mods are on the way!

Sprite credits: Mathew (Maple)
Code credits: Draedon Gaming, Antirhinnum 

For any inquiries, suggestions, or bug reports, contact Drædon Gaming#1669 on Discord or leave a comment here.

As with all code by me, this mod is 100% free and open source, this means you can modify and redistribute to your heart's content. 
*However* please credit both Mathew for the sprites and me for the original code. It'd also be appreciated if you told me about it!
