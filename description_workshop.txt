Have you ever worn an accessory, only to realize it doesn't appear on your character?

Visual Accessories provides a solution! Simply equip the item of your choosing and enjoy!

The base mod supports only vanilla, more addons with compatilibity for other mods are on the way!

For any inquiries, suggestions, or bug reports, contact @reika_chang on Discord or leave a comment here.

As with all code by me, this mod is 100% free and open source, this means you can modify and redistribute to your heart's content. 
*However* please credit both Maple for the sprites and me for the original code. It'd also be appreciated if you told me about it!

Current Version: 1.0
