That's a nice accessory it seems, only it doesn't appear on your character!

Visual Accessories provides a solution! Simply equip the item of your choosing and that's it, you can now wear it!

This mod supports only vanilla, for Calamity's, Thorium's, []'s, []'s, etc. accessories, download this mod plus the respective addon.
